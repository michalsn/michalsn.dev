[{"content":"When building applications that serve multiple clients or domains from a single codebase, developers often face the challenge of managing different configurations for each client. This becomes particularly complex when each client requires separate database credentials, API keys, or other environment-specific settings.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to extend CodeIgniter 4 environment configuration system to support multiple .env files, enabling you to maintain separate configurations for each client while keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.\nThe Multi-Tenant Challenge Before diving into the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s understand the problem we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve. In multi-tenant applications, you typically have two main architectural approaches:\nSingle Database Approach In this approach, all clients share the same database, with data separation handled through tenant identifiers in your database schema. This is simpler to manage and maintain:\nPros: Easy migrations, simpler backup/restore procedures, straightforward analytics across all clients Cons: Data isolation concerns, potential performance bottlenecks, limited customization per client Separate Database Per Client Here, each client gets their own dedicated database instance:\nPros: Complete data isolation, better security, ability to customize schema per client, easier compliance with data regulations Cons: Complex migrations, difficult cross-client analytics, increased maintenance overhead When you choose the separate database approach, you need different database credentials for each client, which is where our .env file challenge begins.\nCodeIgniter 4\u0026rsquo;s Default .env Limitation Out of the box, CodeIgniter 4 supports only a single .env file located in your project root. This file contains environment variables that override your configuration files, making it perfect for storing sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.\nHowever, when you need different configurations for different clients accessing the same application instance, you need a way to load different .env files based on the current client context.\nThe Solution: Custom Boot Class The solution involves creating a custom Boot class that extends CodeIgniter\u0026rsquo;s base Boot class and overriding the loadDotEnv() method. This approach is clean, maintainable, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require core framework modifications.\nStep 1: Create the Custom Boot Class First, create a new file app/AppBoot.php:\n\u0026lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App; use CodeIgniter\\Boot; use CodeIgniter\\Config\\DotEnv; use Config\\Paths; use RuntimeException; /** * Bootstrap for the application * * @codeCoverageIgnore */ class AppBoot extends Boot { /** * Load environment settings from .env files into $_SERVER and $_ENV */ protected static function loadDotEnv(Paths $paths): void { require_once $paths-\u0026gt;systemDirectory . \u0026#39;/Config/DotEnv.php\u0026#39;; $clientName = static::determineClientName(); $envFileName = \u0026#39;.env.\u0026#39; . $clientName; if (file_exists($paths-\u0026gt;appDirectory . \u0026#39;/../\u0026#39; . $envFileName)) { (new DotEnv($paths-\u0026gt;appDirectory . \u0026#39;/../\u0026#39;, $envFileName))-\u0026gt;load(); } else { // Fallback to default .env file (new DotEnv($paths-\u0026gt;appDirectory . \u0026#39;/../\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.env\u0026#39;))-\u0026gt;load(); } } private static function determineClientName(): string { $host = $_SERVER[\u0026#39;HTTP_HOST\u0026#39;] ?? \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; $host = preg_replace(\u0026#39;/^www\\./\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, strtolower($host)); // Hardcoded trusted domains and subdomains $allowedDomains = [ \u0026#39;acmeclient.com\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;acme\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;client1.myapp.com\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;client1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;client2.myapp.com\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;client2\u0026#39;, ]; if (isset($allowedDomains[$host])) { return $allowedDomains[$host]; } throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;Unauthorized domain: {$host}\u0026#34;); } } Step 2: Modify the Bootstrap Process Next, update your public/index.php file to use your custom Boot class:\n\u0026lt;?php use App\\AppBoot; use Config\\Paths; // ... $paths = new Paths(); // LOAD THE FRAMEWORK BOOTSTRAP FILE require $paths-\u0026gt;systemDirectory . \u0026#39;/Boot.php\u0026#39;; // Load our custom bootstrap file require $paths-\u0026gt;appDirectory . \u0026#39;/AppBoot.php\u0026#39;; exit(AppBoot::bootWeb($paths)); Step 3: Create Client-Specific .env Files Now create separate .env files for each client in your project root:\n# .env.client1 database.default.hostname = client1-db.example.com database.default.database = client1_production database.default.username = client1_user database.default.password = super_secure_password_1 app.baseURL = https://client1.myapp.com/ app.indexPage = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # .env.client2 database.default.hostname = client2-db.example.com database.default.database = client2_production database.default.username = client2_user database.default.password = super_secure_password_2 app.baseURL = https://client2.myapp.com/ app.indexPage = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; Security Considerations File Permissions Ensure your .env files have appropriate permissions:\nchmod 600 .env.* Version Control Add all .env files to your .gitignore:\n.env .env.* !.env.example Best Practices Consistent naming: Use a consistent naming convention for your .env files (e.g., .env.clientname) Documentation: Maintain a README or documentation explaining how to add new clients and their configurations Validation: Implement validation to ensure required environment variables are present for each client Security: Always validate the client name to prevent unauthorized access to other clients\u0026rsquo; configurations through domain spoofing Summary Managing multiple .env files in CodeIgniter 4 for multi-client applications doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complicated. By extending the framework\u0026rsquo;s Boot class and implementing smart client detection logic, you can maintain clean separation of concerns while keeping your codebase maintainable.\nRemember that the client detection logic (determineClientName() method) is where you\u0026rsquo;ll implement your specific business rules. You should adapt them to fit your application\u0026rsquo;s unique requirements.\nThis approach provides the flexibility needed for complex multi-tenant applications while preserving the simplicity that makes CodeIgniter 4 so appealing. The separate database approach, while more complex, offers benefits that may be crucial for your specific use case.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/managing-multiple-env-files-in-codeigniter-4/","summary":"When building applications that serve multiple clients or domains from a single codebase, developers often face the challenge of managing different configurations for each client.

This can cause anything from duplicate processing to race conditions and even server slowdowns.\nTo help with that, CodeIgniter Tasks provides a built-in method called singleInstance().\nWhat Is singleInstance()? The singleInstance() method ensures that a task only runs once at a time. If the task is already running, CodeIgniter will skip the next execution to avoid overlapping.\nHere’s how to use it:\n$schedule-\u0026gt;command(\u0026#39;app:my-task\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;everyFiveMinutes() -\u0026gt;singleInstance(); In this example, if app:my-task is still running when it’s scheduled again in 5 minutes, the new run will be skipped.\nSet a Custom Lock Duration By default, the lock created by singleInstance() lasts as long as the task is running. But what if something goes wrong and the task doesn’t finish cleanly? Or maybe you want to be extra safe and avoid lockouts?\nYou can pass a number of seconds to control how long the lock should last:\n$schedule-\u0026gt;command(\u0026#39;data:sync\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;everyMinute() -\u0026gt;singleInstance(MINUTE * 10); // Lock lasts 10 minutes Even if the task crashes, the lock will expire after 10 minutes, allowing future runs to proceed.\nWhen Should You Use It? Use singleInstance() when:\nYour task is long-running The task modifies files, databases, or external systems Overlapping executions could cause problems For example:\n$schedule-\u0026gt;command(\u0026#39;emails:send\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;everyMinute() -\u0026gt;singleInstance(MINUTE * 15); // 15-minute lock to prevent duplicates Schedule Queues as Tasks A recent addition to CodeIgniter Tasks is the ability to schedule queue jobs directly, making it easier to defer work to a background process. Instead of executing heavy logic during the task itself, you can simply dispatch a job:\n$schedule-\u0026gt;queue(\u0026#39;queue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;job-name\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;data\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;array\u0026#39;]) -\u0026gt;everyMinute() -\u0026gt;singleInstance(); This means you can leverage your queue system (like Redis or database-backed queues) for smoother performance and better scalability-while still enjoying the scheduling flexibility of the task scheduler.\nYou can even apply singleInstance() to make sure the job isn’t dispatched more than once while it’s still being processed.\nSummary Using singleInstance() is a simple way to make sure your scheduled tasks don’t step on each other. Whether you’re processing orders, sending emails, or syncing data, it adds a layer of safety - and with optional lock durations, you stay in control even when something goes wrong.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/scheduling-unique-tasks-with-codeigniter/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026rsquo;re scheduling tasks in CodeIgniter 4, it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon to run into issues where the same task gets triggered before the previous one finishes.

But what if you need tasks to run in a specific order? That’s where chained jobs shine.\nWhat Are Chained Jobs? Chained jobs in CodeIgniter Queue allow you to define a sequence of jobs that will be executed one after another, but only if the previous job completes successfully.\nThis is perfect when tasks are dependent on each other - for example:\nGenerate a report Send the report by email With CodeIgniter Queue, chaining these jobs looks like this:\nservice(\u0026#39;queue\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;chain(function($chain) { $chain -\u0026gt;push(\u0026#39;reports\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;generate-report\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;userId\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 123]) -\u0026gt;push(\u0026#39;emails\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Email message goes here\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;userId\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 123, ]); }); How It Works The first job (generate-report) is added to the queue. When it completes successfully, the second job (email) is automatically dispatched. If any job in the chain fails, the rest are not executed, ensuring consistency. Best Practices Keep jobs focused and independent where possible. Implement retries using tries or error handling to make chains more resilient. Monitor logs to understand where a chain might stop due to failure. Summary Chained jobs let you build dependable multistep workflows - without blocking the user experience. Whether it’s generating reports, sending notifications, or processing files, CodeIgniter Queue makes it clean and efficient.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/chained-queue-jobs-in-codeigniter/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJob queues help handle background tasks like sending emails, generating reports, or resizing images - keeping your application fast and responsive.

To simplify it, I made a nice CodeIgniter 4 library that provides two techniques for loading related data: eager loading and lazy loading.\ncomposer require michalsn/codeigniter-nested-model These approaches allow developers to fetch related models in an efficient and intuitive way. Here\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive guide to understanding and using these techniques.\nEager Loading Eager loading fetches related data in advance, minimizing the number of database queries. To implement eager loading, you must define the relations between your models.\nDefining Relations In the following example, we have a UserModel with a one-to-one relation to ProfileModel. The HasRelations trait is used to define these relations.\nclass UserModel extends Model { use HasRelations; public function initialize() { $this-\u0026gt;initRelations(); } public function profile(): Relation { return $this-\u0026gt;hasOne(ProfileModel::class); } } Fetching Data To eagerly load data, use the with() method and specify the relation:\n$users = model(UserModel::class)-\u0026gt;with(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;findAll(); This code performs two queries: one to fetch all users and another to fetch all profiles associated with these users.\nWriting with Relations Eager loading also supports saving related models. For simple relations like hasOne or hasMany, you can save the entire object with its relations:\n$userModel = model(UserModel::class); $user = $userModel-\u0026gt;with(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;find(1); $user-\u0026gt;profile-\u0026gt;favorite_pet = \u0026#39;Cat\u0026#39;; $userModel-\u0026gt;with(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;save($user); Using Transactions When saving objects with relations, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use the useTransactions() method. This ensures that all changes are rolled back if something goes wrong:\n$userModel-\u0026gt;with(\u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;useTransactions()-\u0026gt;save($user); Lazy Loading Lazy loading fetches related data only when it is accessed. This requires your model to use an Entity as the $returnType.\nDefining Relations for Lazy Loading The setup for lazy loading is similar to eager loading but requires an Entity class. The UserModel must use the HasRelations trait, and the $returnType must be set to an entity class:\nclass UserModel extends Model { use HasRelations; protected $returnType = User::class; public function initialize() { $this-\u0026gt;initRelations(); } public function profile(): Relation { return $this-\u0026gt;hasOne(ProfileModel::class); } } Creating the Entity The entity class must use the HasLazyRelations trait:\nclass User extends Entity { use HasLazyRelations; } Fetching Data With lazy loading, data is retrieved on demand when you access the relation property:\n$users = model(UserModel::class)-\u0026gt;findAll(); foreach ($users as $user) { d($user-\u0026gt;profile); } This approach performs an n+1 query pattern: one query to fetch all users and one additional query for each related profile.\nChoosing Between Eager and Lazy Loading Eager Loading: Best when you know in advance which relations you\u0026rsquo;ll need. Reduces the number of queries by preloading data. Lazy Loading: Useful when you don\u0026rsquo;t know which relations will be accessed. However, it can lead to multiple queries and potential performance issues. Both techniques offer flexibility and help optimize database interactions in CodeIgniter 4.

It provides:\nPage View Tracking: Automatically captures page details such as the visitor\u0026rsquo;s operating system, browser, language, screen resolution, and current URL. Event Tracking: Allows logging of custom user interactions, such as clicks or other specified events, with details about the clicked element and its position within the DOM. Configurable Data Transmission: Choose between sending data via sendBeacon (a background-safe transmission for low-impact tracking) or fetch (for added flexibility). Additionally, you can specify whether data should be sent in JSON format or as plain text. Configuration Options The class provides a few configurable properties to suit various use cases:\nsendMethod: Defines how data is transmitted. Acceptable values are: beacon: Uses navigator.sendBeacon for non-blocking, reliable background data transmission. Recommended for scenarios where low-impact logging is preferred. fetch: Uses the Fetch API for standard HTTP transmission, with keepalive set to true. sendJson: If set to true, data is sent in JSON format with Content-Type: application/json. Otherwise, data is sent as plain text (Content-Type: text/plain), which avoids preflight CORS requests. Getting Started To set up PageViewEvents, simply include it in your project and configure any desired options. Here’s how to integrate and use it:\nLoad the Script Add the JavaScript file to your HTML:\n\u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;PageViewEvents.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Configuration Define an optional configuration object, specifying the tracking ID (tid), custom URL, and additional settings if needed:\nconst pveConfig = { // Options for sending data sendOptions: { sendMethod: \u0026#34;fetch\u0026#34;, sendJson: true, sendUrl: \u0026#34;https://example.com/log\u0026#34;, }, // Options for initialization initOptions: { tid: \u0026#34;example-site\u0026#34;, lu: false, luid: \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;, cid: \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;, ip: \u0026#34;127.0.0.1\u0026#34; } }; Initialize and Capture Events Once the script and configuration are in place, initialization of PageViewEvents class is made automatically.

And the initial component call, with two separate instances:\n... \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;row justify-content-md-center mb-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-sm-6 col-lg-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?= view_cell(\u0026#39;Michalsn\\CodeIgniterDemoHtmx\\Cells\\Counter\\CounterCell\u0026#39;); ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-sm-6 col-lg-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?= view_cell(\u0026#39;Michalsn\\CodeIgniterDemoHtmx\\Cells\\Counter\\CounterCell\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;count\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 5]); ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ... Your first impression would be probably something like - that\u0026rsquo;s quite easy task. Just add another variable, like $incrementNumber and call it a day. Well\u0026hellip; yes and no.\nIf we leave it just like that, anyone will be able to edit the URL and increment counter by any number. The point is that we don\u0026rsquo;t want users to be able to change the number by which we will increment the counter in an instance. And this is the time when Signed URLs come to the rescue.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s edit Controlled Cell first:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace Michalsn\\CodeIgniterDemoHtmx\\Cells\\Counter; use CodeIgniter\\View\\Cells\\Cell; class CounterCell extends Cell { public $count = 0; public $incrementNumber = 1; /** * Increment * * @return void */ public function increment() { $this-\u0026gt;count += $this-\u0026gt;incrementNumber; return $this-\u0026gt;render(); } /** * Decrement * * @return void */ public function decrement() { $this-\u0026gt;count -= $this-\u0026gt;incrementNumber; return $this-\u0026gt;render(); } } Now the view part.

Now we can be sure that no one will manipulate the URL, and components will work the way we initailized them.

No wonder, because in a world overflowing with Javascript-based sites that getting more and more complicated to achieve even tiny result, this solution turns out to be a pleasant return to the past - in quite a good way.\nI think we all remember the old days when we wrote in Prototype or jQuery. Back then the option to return HTML chunks was not completely strange. I remember doing it myself - setting various additional options via the data attribute. You usually ended up with one method that tried to do all sorts of requests and update code snippets on the web page depending on the specified container.\nIt all worked, but was somehow not particularly convenient. Fortunately, someone came up with the idea to make a real library that would handle all (or at least most) of the problems we might encounter. And so HTMX was born.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s move on to how we can make it easier to work with HTMX in CodeIgniter. The CodeIgniter-HTMX library will help us with this.\nThe first thing we need to do is install it:\ncomposer require michalsn/codeigniter-htmx Now at our disposal are a number of additional methods from the IncomingRequest, Response and RedirectResponse classes. In addition, we can use a new helper view_fragment(), which will allow us to display only fragments of the view. The last thing is to facilitate the display of errors, which will now be displayed in the modal window. By default, HTMX does not display errors.\nDetailed documentation can be found here: https://michalsn.github.io/codeigniter-htmx/installation/\nAs a bonus, I also suggest taking a look at the repository with examples. There you can find several demos that will show you how we can use HTMX when building our application. You will find several examples:\nBooks - an example of data displayed in a table with pagination, search, sorting and inline editing. Tasks - an example of how we can use events to load content in a slightly more sophisticated way. Paraghraphs - an example of sorting content and editing it in a modal window.

Although this is not a built-in feature, we can deal with it in a fairly simple way.\nSuppose we have an application where each user account is served from its own domain. We can handle this scenarion quite simply through a simple helper:\nUpdate 20/06/2024: The original code used a function that was marked as internal. And as it happens in such cases, this function was removed, with the next update of the framework.\nTherefore, below is already a new version that works:\n// app/Helpers/app_helper.php use CodeIgniter\\HTTP\\SiteURI; use Config\\App; /** * Returns a site URL as defined by Host. * * @param string|array $path URI string * @param string|null $host Host to use */ function account_url($path = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, ?string $host = null): string { if (empty($host)) { return site_url($path); } // Convert array of segments to a string if (is_array($path)) { $path = implode(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, $path); } return (string) new SiteURI(config(App::class), $path, $host); } For posterity, I also leave the original version, which no longer works (probably since the release of version 4.4 of the framework). But everything else remains the same.\n// app/Helpers/app_helper.php /** * Returns a site URL as defined by Host. * * @param string|array $path URI string * @param string|null $host Host to use */ function account_url($path = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, ?string $host = null): string { // Convert array of segments to a string if (is_array($path)) { $path = implode(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, $path); } if (empty($host)) { return site_url($path); } $uri = _get_uri($path); $uri-\u0026gt;setHost($host); return URI::createURIString($uri-\u0026gt;getScheme(), $uri-\u0026gt;getAuthority(), $uri-\u0026gt;getPath(), $uri-\u0026gt;getQuery(), $uri-\u0026gt;getFragment()); } Now we can use our helper function like this:\nhelper(\u0026#39;app\u0026#39;); account_url(\u0026#39;controller/method\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;host.tld\u0026#39;); So basically this helper will work the same as site_url, but it will handle an additional parameter that will define our custom domain.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/generating-a-custom-domain-links-in-codeigniter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow can we handle generation of a custom domain link in CodeIgniter 4?

When we need very high performance it can be a very good alternative to traditional server solutions. Therefore, this time we will try to run CodeIgniter 4 in a serverless environment.\nInstallation The first thing to do is to install the Serverless framework (if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have it). You can read how to do that here: https://bref.sh/docs/installation.html\nFollow all the steps from the \u0026ldquo;Serverless\u0026rdquo; section and come back here.\nIf we already have the Serverless Framework installed and an AWS account configured, we can move on. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a sample project in CodeIgniter 4:\ncomposer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter serverless-ci4 Inside our project, let\u0026rsquo;s install bref, which will allow us to easily run our PHP project on Lambda function.\ncomposer require bref/bref Let\u0026rsquo;s initiate the project.\nvendor/bin/bref init And select the 0 option when asked about the type of apllication.\nConfiguration First things first. We should adjust the serverless.yaml file to our needs:\nservice: serverless-codeigniter4 provider: name: aws region: eu-central-1 runtime: provided.al2 memorySize: 512 plugins: - ./vendor/bref/bref functions: api: handler: public/index.php # point us to the CodeIgniter\u0026#39;s index.php file description: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; timeout: 28 # in seconds (API Gateway has a timeout of 29 seconds) layers: - ${bref:layer.php-81-fpm} events: - httpApi: \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; # Exclude files from deployment package: patterns: - \u0026#39;!node_modules/**\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;!tests/**\u0026#39; Now we can move on. CodeIgniter 4 requires the Intl extension. By default, this extension is disabled, so we need to enable it. To do this, we need to create a php.ini file that will be loaded when the instance is launched.\nIn the root directory of our project, let\u0026rsquo;s create the following path/file: php/conf.d/php.ini with the contents:\nextension=intl Let\u0026rsquo;s move on to CodeIgniter\u0026rsquo;s configuration settings, because there are a few things we need to change. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a copy of the env file under the name .env. Now let\u0026rsquo;s edit the value for CI_ENVIRONMENT and few others.\nCI_ENVIRONMENT = development app.indexPage = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; app.uriProtocol = \u0026#39;PATH_INFO\u0026#39;; We change the CI_ENVIRONMENT just in case something goes wrong, so we can see the errors. Later we will go back to the production value. The change for the uriProtocol is necessary so the Lambda could recognize our routing.\nNext, we need to overwrite the paths for the session (if we will use it) and cache files. In the following example we assume that we use a file handler for both the session and cache files.\n// app/Config/Registrar.php namespace App\\Config; use RuntimeException; class Registrar { public static function App() { $isLambda = isset($_SERVER[\u0026#39;LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT\u0026#39;]); if ($isLambda) { $sessionPathDir = \u0026#39;/tmp/session\u0026#39;; if (! is_dir($sessionPathDir)) { if (! mkdir($sessionPathDir, 0755, true) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ! is_dir($sessionPathDir)) { throw new RuntimeException(sprintf(\u0026#39;Directory \u0026#34;%s\u0026#34; cannot be created\u0026#39;, $sessionPathDir)); } } return [ \u0026#39;sessionSavePath\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $sessionPathDir, ]; } return []; } public static function Cache() { $isLambda = isset($_SERVER[\u0026#39;LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT\u0026#39;]); if ($isLambda) { $cachePathDir = \u0026#39;/tmp/cache\u0026#39;; if (! is_dir($cachePathDir)) { if (! mkdir($cachePathDir, 0755, true) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ! is_dir($cachePathDir)) { throw new RuntimeException(sprintf(\u0026#39;Directory \u0026#34;%s\u0026#34; cannot be created\u0026#39;, $cachePathDir)); } } return [ \u0026#39;file\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;storePath\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $cachePathDir ], ]; } return []; } } The last point will be to change the logging method so that the logs are available in CloudWatch. To do this, we will install a simple extension that will replace our default logger.\ncomposer require bref/logger Let\u0026rsquo;s edit the Services.php file to start using the new logger.\n// app/Config/Services.php namespace Config; use CodeIgniter\\Config\\BaseService; use Bref\\Logger\\StderrLogger; class Services extends BaseService { /** * The Logger class is a PSR-3 compatible Logging class that supports * multiple handlers that process the actual logging. * * @return StderrLogger */ public static function logger(bool $getShared = true) { if ($getShared) { return static::getSharedInstance(\u0026#39;logger\u0026#39;); } return new StderrLogger(); } } We can now upload our project. The first time deploy may take about 2 minutes.\nserverless deploy After navigating to the address that will be displayed to us in the console, we should see the standard landing page of CodeIgniter 4.\nThe last thing we should do is to update the CI_ENVIRONMENT and baseURL variables in the .env file:\nCI_ENVIRONMENT = production app.baseURL = \u0026#39;https://out-instance-number.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\u0026#39; The value for baseURL should be the value displayed to us after deployment in the console.\nNow we should call serverless deploy one more time and we are all set.\nOf course, usually we won\u0026rsquo;t be serving entire websites, but rather providing an API. But if we come to run a full-fledged website, we should remember not to serve the static files through the Lambda function.\nFortunately, there are built-in solutions for this. I encourage you to study the documentation: https://bref.sh/docs/.\nThat would be it. We have a CodeIgniter 4 application served through the Lambda function - in other words: Serverless CodeIgniter 4.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/serverless-codeigniter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eServerless has been very popular for several years now.

I will show you how to do it in CodeIgniter 4 framework.\nThe assumptions are as follows - we have 2 domains:\nprimary domain on which users will be managed and subdomains, on which the application for each user will run In short, this is one of the concepts that are often used by SaaS applications.\nThis can be achieved quite easily. However, when working with CodeIgniter 4 you have to remember that variables defined in .env file have priority over all other changes you try to make while the framework is running.\nWith this in mind - the first thing we will do is to drop the app.baseURL variable from the .env file so that we can dynamically change this value. This variable is not active by default but you may be used to use it.\nFirst things first - we have to edit the app/Config/App.php file and add two variables:\n/** * -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Subdomain URL * -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * Subdomain address for accounts in the system. * * @var string */ public $subdomainURL = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; /** * -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Account ID * -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * Account ID (or empty string for main domain name). * Value \u0026#39;404\u0026#39; means that domain/subdomain is not registered in the system. * * @var string */ public $accountID = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; We will now override the subdomainURL variable in the .env file and add our own variable for baseURL:\nbaseURL = \u0026#39;application.test\u0026#39; // yes, this is correct - we don\u0026#39;t want to use app.baseURL app.subdomainURL = \u0026#39;.application.test\u0026#39; If we use separate variables for the primary domain and subdomain address, our system will become more flexible as it will be able to use different domains for subdomains.\nThe next thing will be to create some form of subdomain creation for each user. I will not go into that here, but I will mention just one thing. It is important to validate subdomain names properly, so that they generate valid URLs.\nIf you keep the subdomain names in the database, then after each change you will have to update the cache in which you will keep informations about subdomains. Let\u0026rsquo;s make an example model method:\npublic function updateSubdomainCache() { $results = $this-\u0026gt;builder()-\u0026gt;select(\u0026#39;account_id, subdomain\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;get()-\u0026gt;getResult(); $subdomain = config(\u0026#39;App\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;subdomainURL); $data = []; foreach ($results as $row) { $data[$row-\u0026gt;subdomain . $subdomain] = $row-\u0026gt;account_id; } cache()-\u0026gt;save(\u0026#39;subdomains\u0026#39;, $data, 0); } Now that we have almost everything we need, we can move on to overriding baseURL address and make it work for subdomains. We are going to use Config/Registrar class which you can read more about here:\nnamespace App\\Config; class Registrar { public static function App() { if (! is_cli()) { if (! $subdomains = cache(\u0026#39;subdomains\u0026#39;)) { $subdomains = []; } $subdomains[env(\u0026#39;baseURL\u0026#39;)] = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; if (isset($subdomains[$_SERVER[\u0026#39;SERVER_NAME\u0026#39;]])) { return [ \u0026#39;baseURL\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; sprintf(\u0026#39;https://%s/\u0026#39;, $_SERVER[\u0026#39;SERVER_NAME\u0026#39;]), \u0026#39;accountID\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $subdomains[$_SERVER[\u0026#39;SERVER_NAME\u0026#39;]] ]; } } return [ \u0026#39;baseURL\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; sprintf(\u0026#39;https://%s/\u0026#39;, env(\u0026#39;baseURL\u0026#39;)), \u0026#39;accountID\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;404\u0026#39; ]; } } Finally, we need to define routing. The primary domain and subdomains will be distinguished using the hostname resolution trick:\n// subdomains routes $routes-\u0026gt;group(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, [], function ($routes) { }); // main domain routes $routes-\u0026gt;group(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;hostname\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; env(\u0026#39;baseURL\u0026#39;)], function ($routes) { }); This way we set the correct application address and additionally the account ID, which will allow us to form correct queries to the database right away.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/setting-dynamic-subdomains-for-every-user-account/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat if we want every user in our application to have his data served through his own subdomain?

You can read more about it in the user guide.\nTo start with a basic question - why not use a query with REPLACE? There are several reasons:\nIf we are dealing with a table that has a field with AUTO INCREMENT, it is then incremented every time. If we have some foreign key relations with ON DELETE CASCADE option, then this it gonna be a mess, because we will automatically delete data from other tables The last reason is the slowness of queries with REPLACE. Each time we try to perform INSERT, if the data is already there, we perform DELETE operation and then another INSERT. The INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE query comes to the rescue. It is a remedy for all the above problems.\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can add support for this type of query to CodeIgniter 4. We will create a Trait class:\n// app/Traits/ExtraModelMethods.php namespace App\\Traits; use CodeIgniter\\Database\\Exceptions\\DataException; use InvalidArgumentException; use ReflectionException; use stdClass; trait ExtraModelMethods { /** * Insert on duplicate key update * * @param array|object $data Data * @param bool $escape Escape * @throws ReflectionException */ public function insertOnDuplicateUpdate($data, ?bool $escape = null): bool { if (! empty($data)) { $data = $this-\u0026gt;transformAllDataToArray($data, \u0026#39;update\u0026#39;); } // Validate data before saving. if (! $this-\u0026gt;skipValidation \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ! $this-\u0026gt;cleanRules(true)-\u0026gt;validate($data)) { return false; } // Must be called first so we don\u0026#39;t // strip out updated_at values. $data = $this-\u0026gt;doProtectFields($data); // doProtectFields() can further remove elements from // $data so we need to check for empty dataset again if (empty($data)) { throw DataException::forEmptyDataset(\u0026#39;update\u0026#39;); } // Set created_at and updated_at with same time $date = $this-\u0026gt;setDate(); if ($this-\u0026gt;useTimestamps \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;createdField \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ! array_key_exists($this-\u0026gt;createdField, $data)) { $data[$this-\u0026gt;createdField] = $date; } if ($this-\u0026gt;useTimestamps \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;updatedField) { $data[$this-\u0026gt;updatedField] = $date; } $builder = $this-\u0026gt;builder(); $insert = $builder-\u0026gt;set($data, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, $escape)-\u0026gt;getCompiledInsert(); // Remove created_at field in case of update query if ($data[$this-\u0026gt;createdField]) { unset($data[$this-\u0026gt;createdField]); } $update = $builder-\u0026gt;set($data, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, $escape)-\u0026gt;getCompiledUpdate(); $update = preg_replace(\u0026#39;/UPDATE[\\s\\S]+?

Let\u0026rsquo;s edit Home controller by adding new methods:\n// app/Controllers/Home.php namespace App\\Controllers; use App\\Models\\ProfileModel; class Home extends BaseController { public function index() { return view(\u0026#39;welcome_message\u0026#39;); } public function add() { $profileModel = model(ProfileModel::class); $profileModel-\u0026gt;insertOnDuplicateUpdate([ \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;James\u0026#39;, ]); } public function edit() { $profileModel = model(ProfileModel::class); $profileModel-\u0026gt;insertOnDuplicateUpdate([ \u0026#39;user_id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Frank\u0026#39;, ]); } } After calling the add() method, we should have one entry in the table with the name \u0026ldquo;James\u0026rdquo;. After calling the edit() method, we should still have one entry in the table, but this time with the name \u0026ldquo;Frank\u0026rdquo;.\nBecause the user_id column is unique, new data is added only if the value for this column is unique. Otherwise, the data is updated.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/insert-on-duplicate-key-update-with-codeigniter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently had to use a query with \u003cstrong\u003eINSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e, but CodeIgniter 4 does not have built-in support for this type of query because it is not available in all database drivers.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE with CodeIgniter 4"},{"content":"Last time I showed you how to easily integrate Mix with CodeIgniter 4. This time we\u0026rsquo;ll complete the integration process by implementing a helper which will make using versioned assets very convenient and easy.\nWhy do we even need this helper? Mix can generate versioned versions of files. In short, it does this by adding a special string to the file name, as a query string. This string is the checksum for the file. If it changes, it tells the browser that it needs to download the resource again, not use the cache.\nWe need to create a file mix_helper.php in app/helpers/ directory:\nif (! function_exists(\u0026#39;mix\u0026#39;)) { /** * Get the path to a versioned Mix file. * * @param string $path * @param string $manifestDirectory * * @return string * * @throws Exception */ function mix(string $path, string $manifestDirectory = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;): string { static $manifests = []; $publicPath = ROOTPATH . \u0026#39;public\u0026#39;; if ($path[0] !== \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;) { $path = \u0026#34;/{$path}\u0026#34;; } if ($manifestDirectory \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $manifestDirectory[0] !== \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;) { $manifestDirectory = \u0026#34;/{$manifestDirectory}\u0026#34;; } if (is_file($publicPath . $manifestDirectory . \u0026#39;/hot\u0026#39;)) { $url = rtrim(file_get_contents($publicPath . $manifestDirectory . \u0026#39;/hot\u0026#39;)); $customUrl = config(\u0026#39;Mix\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;hotProxyUrl; if (! empty($customUrl)) { return $customUrl . $path; } if (strpos($url , \u0026#39;http://\u0026#39;) === 0 || strpos($url , \u0026#39;https://\u0026#39;) === 0) { return explode(\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;, $url, 2)[1] . $path; } return \u0026#34;//localhost:8080{$path}\u0026#34;; } $manifestPath = $publicPath . $manifestDirectory . \u0026#39;/mix-manifest.json\u0026#39;; if (! isset($manifests[$manifestPath])) { if (! is_file($manifestPath)) { throw new Exception(\u0026#39;The Mix manifest does not exist.\u0026#39;); } $manifests[$manifestPath] = json_decode(file_get_contents($manifestPath), true); } $manifest = $manifests[$manifestPath]; if (! isset($manifest[$path])) { $exception = new Exception(\u0026#34;Unable to locate Mix file: {$path}.\u0026#34;); if (!

It\u0026rsquo;s very simple - just enter an ordinary file name and helper will add appropriate query string, based on mix-manifest.json file generated during asset compilation.\nThis is what our asset configuration file will look like (webpack.mix.js):\nlet mix = require(\u0026#39;laravel-mix\u0026#39;); mix.js(\u0026#39;resources/js/app.js\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;js\u0026#39;) .postCss(\u0026#39;resources/css/app.css\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;css\u0026#39;) .version() .setPublicPath(\u0026#39;public\u0026#39;); And in our view we will apply a helper:\n\u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?= mix(\u0026#39;/css/app.css\u0026#39;); ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This will get a link similar to this one:\n\u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;/css/app.css?id=a8b3deb4b7d26dcf51d2\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; The same for JS files.

We need to create a file: app/Libraries/Auth0SessionStorage:\nnamespace App\\Libraries; use Auth0\\SDK\\Store\\StoreInterface; class Auth0SessionStore implements StoreInterface { /** * Session object * * @var \\CodeIgniter\\Session\\Session; */ protected $session; /** * Session variable prefix * * @var string */ protected $prefix = \u0026#39;auth0_\u0026#39;; /** * CodeIgniterSessionStore constructor. */ public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;session = service(\u0026#39;session\u0026#39;); } /** * Persists $value on $_SESSION, identified by $key. * * @param string $key Session key to set. * @param mixed $value Value to use. * * @return void */ public function set(string $key, $value): void { $this-\u0026gt;session-\u0026gt;set($this-\u0026gt;prefix . $key, $value); } /** * Gets persisted values identified by $key. * If the value is not set, returns $default. * * @param string $key Session key to set. * @param mixed $default Default to return if nothing was found. * * @return mixed */ public function get(string $key, $default = null) { return $this-\u0026gt;session-\u0026gt;get($this-\u0026gt;prefix . $key) ?? $default; } /** * Removes a persisted value identified by $key. * * @param string $key Session key to delete. * * @return void */ public function delete(string $key): void { $this-\u0026gt;session-\u0026gt;remove($this-\u0026gt;prefix . $key); } } The last step is to create a service to handle everything conveniently. Let\u0026rsquo;s edit app/Config/Services.php file:\nnamespace Config; use Auth0\\SDK\\Auth0; use Auth0\\SDK\\Exception\\CoreException; use App\\Libraries\\Auth0SessionStore; use Config\\Services as BaseService; class Services extends BaseService { /** * The Auth0 service. * * @param boolean $getShared * * @return Auth0 * @throws CoreException */ public static function auth0(bool $getShared = true) { if ($getShared) { return static::getSharedInstance(\u0026#39;auth0\u0026#39;); } $config = config(\u0026#39;Auth0\u0026#39;); $config = [ \u0026#39;domain\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $config-\u0026gt;domain, \u0026#39;client_id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $config-\u0026gt;clientId, \u0026#39;client_secret\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $config-\u0026gt;clientSecret, \u0026#39;redirect_uri\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $config-\u0026gt;redirectUri, \u0026#39;scope\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $config-\u0026gt;scope, \u0026#39;store\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; new Auth0SessionStore(), ]; return new Auth0($config); } } All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to test the whole thing and create a controller app/Controllers/Auth.php.\nnamespace App\\Controllers; class Auth extends BaseController { public function callback() { return view(\u0026#39;auth\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;user\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; service(\u0026#39;auth0\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;getUser()]); } public function login() { service(\u0026#39;auth0\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;login(); } public function logout() { $config = config(\u0026#39;auth0\u0026#39;); service(\u0026#39;auth0\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;logout(); $logoutUrl = sprintf(\u0026#39;https://%s/v2/logout?client_id=%s\u0026amp;returnTo=%s\u0026#39;, $config-\u0026gt;domain, $config-\u0026gt;clientId, site_url()); $this-\u0026gt;response-\u0026gt;setHeader(\u0026#39;Location\u0026#39;, $logoutUrl); } } And then there\u0026rsquo;s the app/Views/auth.php view:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Auth0 Sample\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php if ($user): ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;?= $user[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;]; ?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?= site_url(\u0026#39;auth/logout\u0026#39;); ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Logout\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php else: ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?= site_url(\u0026#39;auth/login\u0026#39;); ?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Login\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;?php endif; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/integrating-codeigniter-4-with-auth0/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIntegration with \u003ca href=\"https://auth0.com/\"\u003eAuth0\u003c/a\u003e is quite simple and comes down to a few steps.

For this, we need to install CodeIgniter 4 and the AWS library:\ncomposer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter codeigniter-dropzonejs --no-dev composer require aws/aws-sdk-php In the Home controller, we need to create a init_upload method. This method will be quite large. We could avoid it, for example, by creating a special Service to handle tasks related to S3, but because the example is to be as basic as possible, we will put everything in one place:\nuse App\\Controllers\\BaseController; use Aws\\S3\\PostObjectV4; use Aws\\S3\\S3Client; use CodeIgniter\\Exceptions\\PageNotFoundException; class Home extends BaseController { ... public function init_upload() { if (! $this-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;isAjax()) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } if ($this-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getMethod() !== \u0026#39;post\u0026#39;) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } if (! $file = $this-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getPost(\u0026#39;file\u0026#39;)) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } if (! $contentType = $this-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getPost(\u0026#39;content_type\u0026#39;)) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } if (! $md5 = $this-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getPost(\u0026#39;md5\u0026#39;)) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } if (! in_array($contentType, [\u0026#39;image/jpeg\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;image/jpg\u0026#39;])) { throw new PageNotFoundException(); } $file = service(\u0026#39;security\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;sanitizeFilename($file); $client = new S3Client([ \u0026#39;version\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;region\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;type your S3 region here\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;signature\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;v4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;credentials\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;key\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;type your aws key here\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;secret\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;type your aws secret here\u0026#39;, ], ]); $bucket = \u0026#39;type your bucket name here\u0026#39;; $formInputs = [ \u0026#39;acl\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;private\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;key\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $file, \u0026#39;success_action_status\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;201\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;content-md5\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $md5, \u0026#39;content-type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contentType, ]; $options = [ [\u0026#39;acl\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;private\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;bucket\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $bucket], [\u0026#39;success_action_status\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;201\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;content-md5\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $md5], [\u0026#39;content-type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contentType], [\u0026#39;content-length-range\u0026#39;, 0, 1024 * 1024 * 100], [\u0026#39;starts-with\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;$key\u0026#39;, $file], ]; $postObject = new PostObjectV4( $client, $bucket, $formInputs, $options, \u0026#39;+15 minutes\u0026#39; ); $formAttributes = $postObject-\u0026gt;getFormAttributes(); $formInputs = $postObject-\u0026gt;getFormInputs(); return $this-\u0026gt;response-\u0026gt;setJSON([ \u0026#39;status\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, \u0026#39;data\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $file, \u0026#39;presign\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;attributes\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $attributes, \u0026#39;inputs\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $inputs ] ] ]); } } Once we have the presigned URL generated, we need to force Dropzone to use it when uploading the file. We also need to include additional fields and attributes that will describe the exact file we are uploading. We do it this way:\nmyDropzone.on(\u0026#34;sending\u0026#34;, function (file, xhr, formData) { xhr.open(this.options.method, file.presign.attributes.action, true); Object.keys(file.presign.inputs).forEach(function (key) { formData.append(key, file.presign.inputs[key]); }); let _send = xhr.send xhr.send = function () { _send.call(xhr, formData) } }); All that remains now is to handle the success or failure of the upload. In the case of success, we need to change the final name of the file, which may have changed if the name contained forbidden characters:\nmyDropzone.on(\u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, function (file) { let elem = $(file.previewElement); elem.find(\u0026#39;div[data-dz-name]\u0026#39;).text(file.fileName); }); If an error is returned, we should also display an appropriate message. For this purpose, we need to parse the XML response:\nmyDropzone.on(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, function (file, message) { if (file \u0026amp;\u0026amp; message) { if (message.startsWith(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;?xml version\u0026#39;)) { const search = /\u0026lt;Message\u0026gt;(.*?)\u0026lt;\\/Message\u0026gt;/g.exec(message); message = search[1]; this.emit(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, file, message); } } }); This way we can prepare a special upload link and upload the file to S3 using Dropzone.js. Then, S3 will verify the integrity of the file and check that it has the correct parameters that were specified when the special signed URL was generated.\n","permalink":"https://michalsn.dev/posts/upload-files-directly-to-s3-with-dropzonejs-and-codeigniter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUploading files directly to S3 requires a few changes to the way Dropzone handles uploads, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing particularly difficult.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Upload files directly to S3 with Dropzone.js"},{"content":"Up until now, working with UUIDs and CodeIgniter 4 hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much fun, but that has now changed with the codeigniter4-uuid library.\nAdmittedly, working with UUID was not a big challenge when we were working with the Model class, but in order to do it \u0026ldquo;nicely\u0026rdquo;, we had to use Model Events.
