I've recently developed a simple yet educational browser-based game called [Edu Snake Game](https://github.com/michalsn/edu-snake-game). Built with vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas API, this game adds a learning element to the classic Snake gameplay.

In Edu Snake Game, players guide a snake to collect the correct letters that complete a word displayed on the screen. For example, in Polish language learning, a player might need to choose between "ó" or "u" in words like "królik". The game includes multiple word lists that focus on commonly confused spelling patterns.

One of the key features of this project is how easy it is to add your own custom word lists. This makes it ideal for extending the game to teach spelling exceptions, vocabulary, or even letter recognition in different languages. Whether you're helping kids learn to spell or building support for less common language rules, the game can be easily adapted to your needs.
