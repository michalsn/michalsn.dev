Here are some of my personal open source projects that I'm currently working on or have worked on in the past.

### [CodeIgniter Relations](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-relations)

A powerful package that brings elegant relationship management to CodeIgniter 4 applications. It simplifies working with related data across multiple tables with support for eager loading, lazy loading, and nine different relationship types, while preventing N+1 query problems.

### [CodeIgniter Module Manager](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-module-manager)

This package provides a structured system for managing the complete lifecycle of modules in CodeIgniter 4. It enables organizing functionality into self-contained, reusable components with distinct phases for discovery, installation, updates, and maintenance, offering granular control over module activation.

### [CodeIgniter Queue](https://github.com/codeigniter4/queue)

The CodeIgniter Queue library introduces queueing functionality to CodeIgniter 4 applications. This is ideal for handling resource-intensive processes, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of your application. 

> I am thrilled that this project has finally come under the wings of the CodeIgniter Foundation.

### [CodeIgniter HTMX](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-htmx)
 
An integration of HTMX with CodeIgniter 4, this library simplifies building dynamic and interactive front-end features without the need for complex JavaScript frameworks. It enables developers to use HTMX’s powerful AJAX capabilities directly in CodeIgniter, providing a smoother and more efficient user experience.

### [CodeIgniter Signed URL](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-signed-url)
  
This package adds secure, signed URL support to CodeIgniter 4. It allows developers to generate and verify URL signatures, ensuring data integrity and secure access to routes and resources, which is essential for sensitive or time-bound links.

### [CodeIgniter Tags](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-tags)

CodeIgniter Tags is a versatile tagging library that adds robust tagging functionality to CodeIgniter 4 applications. It’s ideal for categorizing content dynamically, making it simple to organize and filter data by tags, providing a richer user and admin experience.

### [CodeIgniter Translatable](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-translatable)

This library provides a flexible way to handle translations in CodeIgniter 4 models. It enables multilingual support by linking translated fields to related tables, making it easy to build multilingual applications with clean separation between core data and localized content.

### [CodeIgniter Markdown Pages](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-markdown-pages)

This project enables Markdown support for content management within CodeIgniter 4, based on files rather than a database. With MarkdownPages, you can create and manage Markdown-based pages easily, making it a practical solution for blogs, documentation, and content-heavy applications.

### [CodeIgniter Nested Model](https://github.com/michalsn/codeigniter-nested-model)

A powerful extension for CodeIgniter 4 model system that allows working with nested or related models more conveniently. It streamlines the loading, saving, and updating of related data structures, making it easier to manage complex entities and their relationships with minimal boilerplate code. 

> This project served as a proof of concept, which later evolved into CodeIgniter Relations — a more mature solution with solid fundamentals and comprehensive relationship management.
